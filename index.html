            <h2>The Salt March</h2>
            <p>The Salt March was an act of nonviolent civil disobedience in colonial India led by Mahatma Gandhi.
            </p>
            <p>It was a protest against the British salt monopoly, which among other things, forbade Indians from making their own salt.
            </p>
            <p>The march started from Gandhi's ashram at Sabarmati in Gujarat and ended at Dandi on the west coast of India.  It was a journey of 390 km.
            </p>
            <p>The twenty-four day March lasted from 12 March 1930 to 5 April 1930 as a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly.
            </p>
            <p>Once the marchers reached the ocean, they began to make salt on the beaches of the Arabian Sea.
            </p>
            <p>The protesters were assaulted with police batons, arrested, and imprisoned.
            </p>
            <p>The protest helped to bring the plight of the Indian population to world attention and was one of the successful parts of the campaign for Indian independence.
